# **[Work In Progress]** AS-11 X8 (MXF Program Contribution - NABA DPP HD (MPEG-2))

_This file is one rendering / view of this AMWA Specification and is a part of the Specification repository. Visit the AMWA [web page for this Specification](http://amwa.tv/projects/AS-11-X8.shtml) which has information about revisions and current development._


# AS-11: Media Contribution File Formats

The AMWA AS-11 Specifications define constrained media file formats for the delivery of finished media assets to a broadcaster or publisher. Each Specification is developed for a particular business purpose.


# Purpose of the AS-11 X8 Specification

## Aims

This Specification aims to define a file format for the delivery of finished HD TV Programmes (MPEG-2) to [North American Broadcasters Association](http://www.nabanet.com/) (NABA) broadcasters. It aims to define:

* a vendor-neutral and broadcaster-neutral package, using open technologies for delivery of finished programming from program producers and program distributors to broadcast stations
* a package that is sufficiently simple so as to limit the scope for interoperability problems
* a self-contained & play-out ready package

## Some notes on practical use

* The content may be delivered at the broadcast bit-rate, picture format and aspect ratio, or it may be transcoded at the broadcast station to the bit-rates and formats required for particular broadcast channels. Similar transcoding may be applied to audio and captions; additionally, specific audio and caption tracks may be selected for different broadcast channels.
* The content may be pre-packaged for broadcast without further changes or it may be segmented for ease of insertion or replacement of interstitials.
* There may be more than one package per programme.
* The package may contain some pre and post roll content not for transmission.


# Understanding the Specification Blocks Tree

This Specification is formed of "Blocks" that naturally form a "tree". A rendering / view of this tree is shown below and is explained here.

## Entities Summary
The Specification-writing framework used to produce this Specification has several different types of component / entity. In summary:

* Each Specification is composed of a single Top-Level **Block (B)**
* Blocks are defined by containing **Artefacts (A)** or linking directly to other Blocks
* Artefacts often refer to **Terms (T)** and **References (R)** as well as Blocks
* Blocks are sometimes described by **Notes (N)**

Each entity is identified by a unique URL.

Some of the letters in brackets above are used in the tree view to identify the type of each entity.

## Conformance

An implementation complies with a Block if it complies with all of the Blocks / Artefacts from which it is constructed. "Informative" statements do not have to be complied with (details of "informative" statements are given below).

* Compliance with some Blocks is not mandatory. Such Blocks are marked with an alternative "conformance" state (such as "optional" or "recommended").
* The name / title of an entity is considered "informative", as is its "description" (if present).
* "Note" entities are considered "informative".
* Prose Artefacts are written as statements of fact. An implementation complies with one of these Artefacts if the stated fact is True for the implementation.
* Some Artefacts are "data files" such as SMPTE Metadata Registers XML files or XML Schema files. Some of these may be partially rendered below. An implementation must always fully comply with these data files.

_Note that an Artefact does not always make sense on its own: all of the Artefacts contained within a Block need to be read (in order) to understand the Block fully and correctly._

## Parameter Blocks

There are two special types of Block which allow the value of one Block to be set by another Block:

* **Parameter Key Block (K)** -- this is a Block whose value must be set elsewhere in the Specification (it effectively defines a "variable" or an "argument")
* **Parameter Value Block (V)** -- this is a Block which sets the value of a specific Parameter Key Block (K)



# The Specification Blocks Tree

[B] File Format
    [B] SMPTE RDD 9 (with variations)
        Conformance: mandatory
        [A] The file conforms to <SMPTE RDD 9:2013> with the additional constraints and deviations from the Specification detailed here.
        [A] The <Picture Essence> and <Sound Essence> match one of the configurations listed in this table.
            
             Configuration Name | RDD 9 "categorization" | MPEG-2 Profile & Level | MPEG-2 bit rate | Video frame dimensions | Video frame rate | Progressive or Interlaced | Color Subsampling | Audio sample quantisation
             -------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------
             Option 1a          | HD420                  | MP@HL                  | 35 Mbit/s       | 1280x720               | 59.94            | Progressive               | 4:2:0             | 16-bit
             Option 1b          | HD420                  | MP@HL                  | 35 Mbit/s       | 1920x1080              | 29.97            | Interlaced                | 4:2:0             | 16-bit
             Option 2a          | HD422                  | 4:2:2P@HL              | 50 Mbit/s       | 1280x720               | 59.94            | Progressive               | 4:2:2             | 24-bit
             Option 2b          | HD422                  | 4:2:2P@HL              | 50 Mbit/s       | 1920x1080              | 29.97            | Interlaced                | 4:2:2             | 24-bit
        [A] There are any number of <Audio Channel>s in the file up to a maximum of 16.
        [N] Variation from RDD 9
            [A] <SMPTE RDD 9:2013> includes all of the components of the configurations in the table here, but not necessarily in these combinations. Option 1b is not specified in <SMPTE RDD 9:2013>, but all of its constituent parts are. 
                
                To be strictly conformant to <SMPTE RDD 9:2013>, files must have 2, 4 or 8 <Audio Channel>s (which is allowed is dependent on which category of <Picture Essence> is used).
                
    [B] Closed Complete Header
        Conformance: mandatory
        [A] The <Header Partition> is "Closed" and "Complete".
        [N] Implementation Notes
            [A] Byte 15 of the Header Partition Pack Key must be set to 04h and all Header Metadata must have correct values. Hence 'Distinguished Values' cannot be used for 'Best Effort' properties. See Section 6.2.3 of SMPTE ST 377-1:2011 for a full explanation.
    [B] Timecode constraints
        Conformance: mandatory
        [B] Constrained Timecode Track in Material Package
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The <Timecode Track> in the <Material Package> is a <Constrained Timecode Track>.
                [B] Constrained Timecode Track
                    [A] A <Constrained Timecode Track> is a <Timecode Track>.
                    [A] The value of the "Edit Rate" property of this <Timecode Track> is the same as the value of the "Edit Rate" property of the <Picture Track> in the same <Package>.
                    [A] There is exactly one <Timecode Component> in this <Timecode Track>.
                    [A] The value of the "Rounded Timecode Base" property of the <Timecode Component> is the "Edit Rate" of this <Timecode Track> rounded to the nearest integer.
        [B] Timecode mode signalling
            Conformance: recommended
            [A] The value of the "Drop Frame" property of the <Timecode Component> in the <Timecode Track> in the <Material Package> is "False" (indicating non-drop frame timecode is in use) except in any of the following scenarios (in which case it is "True", indicating drop frame timecode is in use):
                
                * The "Rounded Timecode Base" property of the <Timecode Component> is `60` and the "Edit Rate" of the <Timecode Track> is mathematically equal to `60000/1001`
                * The "Rounded Timecode Base" property of the <Timecode Component> is `30` and the "Edit Rate" of the <Timecode Track> is mathematically equal to `30000/1001`
            [N] Rational Numbers
                [A] Care must be taken when dealing with numbers expressed as a ratio of two integers ("rationals"). They are often used to represent temporal rates or image aspect ratios.
                    
                    When making comparisons of these values, it is insufficient to simply compare each of the numerators and each of the denominators. For example, `7/5` is mathematically equal to `14/10`.
        [B] Timecode Track Precedence
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The <Timecode Track> in the <Material Package> defines the authoritative program timecode.
            [N] Implementation Notes
                [A] The <Timecode> defined by the <Timecode Track> in the <Material Package> must be used by all the components of a system that handles the file. Other <Timecode>s could be present in the file but these are not authoritative -- these other <Timecode>s could be used by certain systems for very specialist purposes (such as keeping track of where each frame of content originated from) but they must never be used as the authoritative / principal <Timecode> for the content.
    [B] Header Metadata KLV Fill
        Conformance: recommended
        [A] When first created, the file includes a <KLV Fill> item of at least 4 MB in total length following the <Header Metadata>.
        [N] Implementation Notes
            [A] The "total length" is of the entire item and includes the length of the Key and Length fields.
                
                The extra space afforded by the KLV Fill allows Header Metadata to be edited and added to without rewriting the entire file.
        [N] Definition of megabyte
            [A] The unit symbol "MB" refers to a megabyte, which is 1 000 000 bytes.
    [B] Audio Layout
        Conformance: mandatory
        [A] An <Audio Layout Mode> is used with the properties set as specified by <Audio Layout Mode 0>.
            [B] Audio Layout Mode
                [A] The value of <Channel Assignment Label> is a SMPTE Universal Label that is used as the value of the "ChannelAssignment" property in the {WAVEPCMDescriptor}.
                [A] If <MCA Labeling Present> is "true" then <Constrained Multichannel Audio Labeling Framework> is used. Otherwise the Multichannel Audio Labeling Framework specified in <SMPTE ST 377-4:2012> is not used.
                    [B] Constrained Multichannel Audio Labeling Framework
                        [A] The file uses the Multichannel Audio Labeling Framework specified in <SMPTE ST 377-4:2012>.
                        [A] There is exactly one <AudioChannelLabelSubDescriptor> for each <Audio Channel>. This <AudioChannelLabelSubDescriptor> is strongly referenced by the "SubDescriptors" property of the <Generic Sound Essence Descriptor> of the <Sound Track> that contains the <Audio Channel>.
                        [A] There is exactly one <SoundfieldGroupLabelSubDescriptor> for each <Soundfield Group>. This <SoundfieldGroupLabelSubDescriptor> is strongly referenced by the "SubDescriptors" property of the <Generic Sound Essence Descriptor> of a <Sound Track> in the <Soundfield Group>.
                        [A] There is one or more <GroupOfSoundfieldGroupsLabelSubDescriptor>(s) for each <Soundfield Group>. Each of these <GroupOfSoundfieldGroupsLabelSubDescriptor>s is strongly referenced by the "SubDescriptors" property of the <Generic Sound Essence Descriptor> of a <Sound Track> in the <Soundfield Group>.
                        [A] Each <AudioChannelLabelSubDescriptor> references exactly one <SoundfieldGroupLabelSubDescriptor>.
                        [A] Each <SoundfieldGroupLabelSubDescriptor> references all of the <GroupOfSoundfieldGroupsLabelSubDescriptor>(s) for the <Soundfield Group> it relates to.
                        [A] In each <AudioChannelLabelSubDescriptor> the following (ordinarily optional) properties are present: "MCA Tag Name", "MCA Channel ID".
                        [A] In each <AudioChannelLabelSubDescriptor> the following (ordinarily optional) properties are not present: "RFC 5646 Spoken Language".
                        [A] In each <SoundfieldGroupLabelSubDescriptor> the following (ordinarily optional) properties are present: "MCA Tag Name", "RFC 5646 Spoken Language".
                        [A] In each <SoundfieldGroupLabelSubDescriptor> the following (ordinarily optional) properties are not present: "MCA Channel ID".
                        [A] In each <GroupOfSoundfieldGroupsLabelSubDescriptor> the following (ordinarily optional) properties are present: "MCA Tag Name".
                        [A] In each <GroupOfSoundfieldGroupsLabelSubDescriptor> the following (ordinarily optional) properties are not present: "MCA Channel ID", "RFC 5646 Spoken Language".

                                If several <Soundfield Group>s reference a single <Group of Soundfield Groups> then there will be more than one <GroupOfSoundfieldGroupsLabelSubDescriptor> for that <Group of Soundfield Groups>. That is, it is repeated for each <Soundfield Group> that references it.

                    [A] http://www.amwa.tv/projects/rules/01/note/GroupOfSoundfieldGroups/artefacts/Labels.xml
                [N] MCA Tag Symbol prefixes
                    [A] The MCA Tag Symbols for labels that are used here but defined elsewhere have had prefixes applied to the values specified in their defining documents.
                        
                        These prefixes (`ch` for Audio Channel; `sg` for Soundfield Group; `gg` for Group of Soundfield Group) are also applied by the Digital Cinema and IMF applications of the Multichannel Audio Labeling framework (SMPTE ST 377-4), so this Specification uses the same MCA Tag Symbols as used in those applications.
                [N] Labels used here but defined elsewhere
                    [A] Some of the Labels listed here are defined elsewhere. For a full explanation of such Labels, refer to the document detailed in the `DefiningDocument` element for the Label in the relevant XML.
                [N] Labeling Audio Description
                    [A] The anticipated application of these Labels to "Audio Decsription" is as follows:
                        
                        * `AudioDescription` will be used with `AudioDescriptionStudioSignal`
                        * `AudioDescriptionProgramMix` will be used with `SMPTEST20678StandardStereo`
                        
                        Other valid combinations of "Soundfield Group" and "Group of Soundfield Groups" Labels are also possible.
                [N] Unused Audio Labelling
                    [A] The "Unused Audio" label is expected to be used when channels are part of a fixed audio layout but are not used for the program or associated content. The Audio Channel and Soundfield Group labels are still used to label the physical properties of the unused audio, but the Soundfield Group references the "Unused Audio" Group Of Soundfield Groups label to indicate the channels are unused.
        [N] Implementation Notes
            [A] # "MCA Label Dictionary ID" Labels Used
                
                Note that no constraint is placed on which "MCA Label Dictionary ID" Labels can be used in the file. The stated constraint simply means that implementations that comply with this Block must be able to support all of the specified Labels. In practice this means that for most real Sound Tracks the specified Labels ought to be used but alternative Labels can be used if the need arises (for example to support the delivery of additional specialist Sound Tracks for which Labels have been privately agreed between the supplier and the broadcaster).
    [B] Embedded XML Documents
        Conformance: mandatory
        [A] An XML document defined by <XML DM for Programmes> is embedded in the file using <XML Document in Header Metadata Carriage>.
            [B] XML DM for Programmes
                [A] The namespace of the document's root element is <Programmes Descriptive Metadata>; the name of the document's root element is "Programmes_DM"; the Media type (MIME type) for the document is "application/xml"
                    [B] Programmes Descriptive Metadata
                        [A] http://www.amwa.tv/projects/rules/01/block/DM_Programmes/artefacts/DM_Programmes.xsd
            [B] XML Document in Header Metadata Carriage
                [A] The XML document is a complete XML document (with a single root element) that is UTF-8 encoded without a "Byte-Order Mark" (BOM).
                [A] The XML document is carried in the <Header Metadata> according to <SMPTE RP 2057:2011>.
                [A] The instance of "Text-Based DM Framework" is strongly referenced from a <Constrained Static DM Track>.
                    [B] Constrained Static DM Track
                        [A] A <Constrained Static DM Track> is a <Static Track (DM)> in the <Material Package> that contains a <Sequence>, which contains exactly one <DM Segment>, which strongly references an instance of a <DM Framework>.
                        [N] Track Name
                            [A] The "Track Name" property of an <Constrained Static DM Track> does not identify the <DM Scheme> whose <DM Framework> it references. In the absence of other requirements for "Track Name", it is suggested that files use a value corresponding to the <DM Scheme> used in the track, e.g. "AS_11_Core", "AS_11_UKDPP".
                [A] The XML document is carried in the "UTF-8 Text Data" property of the "UTF-8 Text-based Set".
                [A] In the "UTF-8 Text-based Set" the property "Text-based Metadata Payload Scheme ID" has the value of <DM_XML_Document>.
                    [B] DM_XML_Document
                        [A] http://www.amwa.tv/projects/rules/01/block/XMLDMLabel/artefacts/Labels.xml
                [A] In the "UTF-8 Text-based Set" the property "Text Data Description" is present and has a value equal to the namespace of the root element of the XML document.
                [A] <2-byte Local Length Encoding> is used for both the "Text-Based DM Framework" and the "UTF-8 Text-based Set".
                [N] ST 2057 Implementation Notes
                    [A] ## XML Document size limits
                        The constraints mean that Byte 6 of the two set keys will be 53h. The amount of text data must be equal to or less than 65535 bytes.
                        
                        ## Amendment
                        A crucial amendment to ST 2057 exists and must be read carefully -- it changes the ULs of various keys used in the Standard.
    [B] AS-11 Segmentation DM
        Conformance: mandatory
        [A] The file contains exactly one <Program Segmentation Track>.
            [B] Program Segmentation Track
                [A] A <Program Segmentation Track> is a <Timeline Track> that contains a <Sequence> that is composed of zero or more <Filler> objects and one or more <DM Segment> objects.
                [A] Each <DM Segment> object in the <Program Segmentation Track> represents, and aligns with, a region of program content in the <Source Essence>.
                [A] Each <Filler> object in the <Program Segmentation Track> represents, and aligns with, a region of non-program content in the <Source Essence>.
                [N] Track Name
                    [A] The "Track Name" property of the <Program Segmentation Track> does not identify the segmentation metadata scheme. In the absence of other requirements for "Track Name", it is suggested that files use a value corresponding to the <DM Scheme> used in the track, e.g.  "AS_11_Segmentation".
                [N] Determining SOM and EOM
                    [A] The start and end timecodes for program regions, commonly referred to as "start of material" (som) and "end of material" (eom), can be determined based on the location of <DM Segment> objects on the <Program Segmentation Track> relative to the adjacent <Timecode Track> in the <Material Package> that contains the <Program Segmentation Track>.
                [N] Non-Programme Content
                    [A] Examples of non-programme content include: black, ident, clock.
                [N] Track Composition
                    [A] Constraints set out in <SMPTE ST 377-1:2011> and <SMPTE ST 378:2004> mean that the <Program Segmentation Track> is necessarily full from start to finish and is the same length as all other <Timeline Track>s in the <Material Package>.
        [A] This <Track> is in the <Material Package>.
        [A] Each <DM Segment> object in the <Track> strongly references an instance of <DM_AS_11_Segmentation>.
            [B] DM_AS_11_Segmentation
                [A] This <DM Scheme> is identified by <DM_AS_11_Segmentation> (the <DM Scheme Label>) and has the following members: <DM_AS_11_Segmentation_Framework> (the <DM Framework>).
                    [B] DM_AS_11_Segmentation
                        [A] http://www.amwa.tv/projects/rules/01/block/505L/artefacts/Labels.xml

        [N] Implementation Notes
            [A] The <Track> can be identified by an MXF reader by the presence of <DM Segment> objects that each strongly reference an instance of the "DM_AS_11_Segmentation_Framework" <DM Framework>.
        [N] Repetition of Header Metadata
            [A] Repetition of Header Metadata in the Footer Partition is not considered to be another instance of any of the components of that Header Metadata.
    [B] Specification Identification
        Conformance: mandatory
        [A] The <Specification_Identifiers> Element is present in the <Preface> of the <Header Partition>.

    [B] Dolby Audio Metadata
        Conformance: optional
        [A] The <Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream> that describes an <Audio Program> is included in the file using <Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream Carriage>.
            [B] Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream Carriage
                [A] The mapping of a <Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream> into <VANC Data Packet>s conforms to <SMPTE 2020-B>.
                [A] The mapping of <VANC Data Packet>s into <ANC Frame Element>s is as specified in <Constrained Ancillary Data Mapping>.
                    [B] Constrained Ancillary Data Mapping
                        [A] The mapping of <VANC Data Packet>s into <ANC Frame Element>s is as specified in <SMPTE ST 436-1:2013> where "Payload Sample Coding" is "8-bit luma samples" (04h) and "Wrapping Type" is: "VANC Frame" (01h) (for interlaced or segmented progressive <Picture Essence>) or "VANC Progressive Frame" (04h) (for full-frame progressive <Picture Essence>).
                [A] The "Line Number" used for each field's <VANC Data Packet> in the <ANC Frame Element> is the same for all <VANC Data Packet>s for that field for the identified <Audio Program>.
                [N] Implementation Notes
                    [A] # Use of Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream Carriage
                        
                        The file can use Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream Carriage to carry audio presentation metadata for zero, one or more than one SoundfieldGroups / Audio Programs.
                        
                        # SDID value
                        
                        SMPTE ST 2020-1 specifies that the SDID value within the VANC Data Packet be used to identify the Sound Tracks that make up the Audio Program. For example, VANC Data Packets that contain Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream for a 5.1 channel Audio Program starting at channel pair 5/6 will require the SDID value in the VANC Data Packet to be set to 04h.
                        
                        However, this approach only works inside an MXF file if every Audio Channel in the file is identifiable using a pan-file channel number. This is the case if, for example, the Sound Tracks in the MXF file are numbered mono Sound Tracks.
                        
                        However, if the Sound Tracks in the MXF file are Multichannel Sound Tracks then this approach does not work. Some consequences of this:
                        
                        * The value to be used for SDID is undefined.
                        * If more than one 5.1 SoundfieldGroup (and at least one Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream) is included in the file then an external mechanism is needed to relate SoundfieldGroups and Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstreams.
                        * The SDID values might need to be rewritten upon output so that they correctly identify the Audio Channels that are being used to carry the relevant SoundfieldGroup / Audio Program. For example, this might be the case when playing out an MXF file to SDI -- particularly if only certain audio is played out or the audio layout is changed.
                        
                        # DID value
                        
                        VANC Data Packets that are carrying Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream will have a DID value of 45h.
                        
                        # Packets are not constant throughout
                        
                        SMPTE 2020-B requires that there is "one packet in each field of interlaced video formats". However, the two packets in each interlaced video frame are not identical.
                        
                        The values of SMPTE RDD 6 metadata properties might change from one frame to the next, but normally they will not. However, the VANC Data Packets in the file will not be identical even if the metadata is static: the "frame_count" will certainly increment and the "description_text" (if not null) will change.
                        
                        # Other data being carried in the ANC Frame Element
                        
                        The ANC Frame Element can also contain HANC Data Packets and other VANC Data Packets in addition to those carrying Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstreams. Irrespective of what data is carried in the ANC Frame Element, there is only ever one Track (in each of the Material Package and Top-Level File Package), one Data Element, and one associated Essence Descriptor in the MXF file.
                        
    [B] Closed Captions
        Conformance: optional
        [A] <Caption Distribution Packet>s are included in the file using <Closed Captions Carriage>.
            [B] Closed Captions Carriage
                [A] The mapping of <Caption Distribution Packet>s into <VANC Data Packet>s conforms to <SMPTE ST 334-1:2015>.
                [A] The mapping of <VANC Data Packet>s into <ANC Frame Element>s is as specified in <Constrained Ancillary Data Mapping>.
                    [B] Constrained Ancillary Data Mapping
                        [A] The mapping of <VANC Data Packet>s into <ANC Frame Element>s is as specified in <SMPTE ST 436-1:2013> where "Payload Sample Coding" is "8-bit luma samples" (04h) and "Wrapping Type" is: "VANC Frame" (01h) (for interlaced or segmented progressive <Picture Essence>) or "VANC Progressive Frame" (04h) (for full-frame progressive <Picture Essence>).

                    [A] # DID and SDID values
                        
                        <VANC Data Packet>s that are carrying <Caption Distribution Packet> will have a DID value of 61h and a SDID value of 01h.

Irrespective of what data is carried in the <ANC Frame Element>, there is only ever one <Track> (in each of the <Material Package> and Top-Level File Package), one Data Element, and one associated Essence Descriptor in the MXF file.
