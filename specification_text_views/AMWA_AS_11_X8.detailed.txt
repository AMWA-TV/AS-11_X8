# AS-11: Media Contribution File Formats

The AMWA AS-11 Specifications define constrained media file formats for the delivery of finished media assets to a broadcaster or publisher. Each Specification is developed for a particular business purpose.


# Purpose of the AS-11 X8 Specification

## Aims

This Specification aims to define a file format for the delivery of finished HD TV Programmes (MPEG-2) to [North American Broadcasters Association](http://www.nabanet.com/) (NABA) broadcasters. It aims to define:

* a vendor-neutral and broadcaster-neutral package, using open technologies for delivery of finished programming from program producers and program distributors to broadcast stations
* a package that is sufficiently simple so as to limit the scope for interoperability problems
* a self-contained & play-out ready package

## Some notes on practical use

* The content may be delivered at the broadcast bit-rate, picture format and aspect ratio, or it may be transcoded at the broadcast station to the bit-rates and formats required for particular broadcast channels. Similar transcoding may be applied to audio and captions; additionally, specific audio and caption tracks may be selected for different broadcast channels.
* The content may be pre-packaged for broadcast without further changes or it may be segmented for ease of insertion or replacement of interstitials.
* There may be more than one package per programme.
* The package may contain some pre and post roll content not for transmission.


# Understanding the Specification Blocks Tree

## The Rules-Based Specification Framework
This Specification has been written using a 'Rules-based Specification Framework'. In this framework, each 'constraint' or 'rule' is expressed as a 'Component' which can be unambiguously identified by its ID (the Component ID is a web address / URL; there need not be any content available at this web address). These Components assemble into 'networks' or 'webs' to form complete Specifications, with many Components being re-used across a number of Specifications. Through this approach machine processable Specifications are developed which are less ambiguous and easier to implement and test. To read a more detailed introduction to the Rules-based Specification Framework refer to [Rules-Based Specifications: Modelling and Processing](http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/publications/whitepaper319).

* **Blocks (B)** are the fundamental 'building bricks' of a Specification -- they provide its _structure_.
* A Block can either link to **Artefacts (A)** that it 'owns' or link to other Blocks.
* Artefacts provide the real _content_ of a Specification. They may contain textual statements, code excerpts, or tables, for example.
* Artefacts often refer to **Terms (T)** and **References (R)** as well as Blocks.
* Blocks are sometimes described by **Notes (N)**.
* There are two special types of Block which allow the value of one Block to be set by another Block:
    * **Parameter Key Block (K)** -- this is a Block whose value must be set elsewhere in the Specification (it effectively defines a "variable" or an "argument").
    * **Parameter Value Block (V)** -- this is a Block which sets the value of a specific Parameter Key Block.

In this document the network of Blocks (and other Components) that form the Specification are shown as a 'tree': the Specification Blocks Tree. The letters in brackets above are used in the tree to identify the different kinds of Component.

## Conformance

An implementation complies with this Specification if it complies with the Components from which it is constructed, as shown in the Specification Blocks Tree, subject to the following provisions:

* An implementation complies with a Block if it complies with all of the normative Components from which it is constructed. "Informative" items (as defined below) do not have to be complied with.
* "Note" Components are considered "informative". All other Components are considered "normative" unless otherwise noted.
* Compliance with some Blocks is not mandatory. Such Blocks are marked with an alternative "conformance" state (such as "optional" or "recommended").
* The name / title of a Component is considered "informative".
* Prose Artefacts are written as statements of fact. An implementation complies with one of these Artefacts if the stated fact is True for the implementation.
* Other Artefacts are "data files" (such as SMPTE Metadata Registers XML files or XML Schema files). Some of these may be _partially_ rendered below. An implementation must always fully comply with these data files -- links are provided to such data files in the Specification Blocks Tree.
* Note that an Artefact does not always make sense on its own: all of the Artefacts contained within a Block need to be read (in order) to understand the Block fully and correctly.

            [N] Rational Numbers
                <Component ID: http://www.amwa.tv/projects/rules/01/note/E69/>
                [A] Care must be taken when dealing with numbers expressed as a ratio of two integers ("rationals"). They are often used to represent temporal rates or image aspect ratios.
                    
                    When making comparisons of these values, it is insufficient to simply compare each of the numerators and each of the denominators. For example, `7/5` is mathematically equal to `14/10`.

                                <SoundfieldGroupLabelSubDescriptor>s and <GroupOfSoundfieldGroupsLabelSubDescriptor>s could all be on one <Sound Track> or distributed. Hence, even the <GroupOfSoundfieldGroupsLabelSubDescriptor>s might not be on the same <Sound Track>.
                                
                                If several <Soundfield Group>s reference a single <Group of Soundfield Groups> then there will be more than one <GroupOfSoundfieldGroupsLabelSubDescriptor> for that <Group of Soundfield Groups>.

                                * The `RFC5646SpokenLanguage` property of the {MCALabelSubDescriptor} is defined in SMPTE ST 377-4:2012 as having the type "ISO-8String". This type is undefined.
                                
                                * However, the entry for `RFC5646SpokenLanguage` in the SMPTE Elements Register correctly lists the type as "ISO7", which refers to "ISO/IEC 646:1991, Information technology -- ISO 7-bit coded character set for information interchange.". That is the same character repertoire referenced by IETF RFC 5646.

                        These prefixes (`ch` for Audio Channel; `sg` for Soundfield Group; `gg` for Group of Soundfield Group) are also applied by the Digital Cinema and IMF applications of the Multichannel Audio Labeling framework (SMPTE ST 377-4), so this Specification uses the same MCA Tag Symbols as used in those applications.

                [N] Labeling Audio Description
                    <Component ID: http://www.amwa.tv/projects/rules/01/note/E32/>
                    [A] The anticipated application of these Labels to "Audio Decsription" is as follows:
                        
                        * `AudioDescription` will be used with `AudioDescriptionStudioSignal`
                        * `AudioDescriptionProgramMix` will be used with `SMPTEST20678StandardStereo`
                        
                        Other valid combinations of "Soundfield Group" and "Group of Soundfield Groups" Labels are also possible.

                    [A] The "Unused Audio" label is expected to be used when channels are part of a fixed audio layout but are not used for the program or associated content. The Audio Channel and Soundfield Group labels are still used to label the physical properties of the unused audio, but the Soundfield Group references the "Unused Audio" Group Of Soundfield Groups label to indicate the channels are unused.

            [A] # "MCA Label Dictionary ID" Labels Used
                
                Note that no constraint is placed on which "MCA Label Dictionary ID" Labels can be used in the file. The stated constraint simply means that implementations that comply with this Block must be able to support all of the specified Labels. In practice this means that for most real Sound Tracks the specified Labels ought to be used but alternative Labels can be used if the need arises (for example to support the delivery of additional specialist Sound Tracks for which Labels have been privately agreed between the supplier and the broadcaster).

            [A] This Block does not prohibit other text documents (XML or otherwise) from also being embedded in the MXF file. This could be useful because it allows custom XML documents also to be carried along with the mandated XML document(s).
                
                Note that the stated constraints help readers in identifying the mandated XML document(s); if a device examines all sets / objects that meet all of the following criteria:
                
                * it is an instance of a "Text-based Object" (so it is a "Generic Stream Text-based Set", "UTF-8 Text-based Set" or "UTF-16 Text-based Set")
                * it is in the <Material Package>
                * the "Text-based Metadata Payload Scheme ID" property has the specified value
                
                then the set / object containing a specific mandated XML document can be uniquely identified by the value of its "Text Data Description" property (this property contains the namespace of the root element of the XML document).
