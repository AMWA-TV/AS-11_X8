# **[Work In Progress]** AS-11 X8 (MXF Program Contribution - NABA DPP HD (MPEG-2))

_This file is one rendering / view of this AMWA Specification and is a part of the Specification repository. Visit the AMWA [web page for this Specification](http://amwa.tv/projects/AS-11-X8.shtml) which has information about revisions and current development._


# AS-11: Media Contribution File Formats

The AMWA AS-11 Specifications define constrained media file formats for the delivery of finished media assets to a broadcaster or publisher. Each Specification is developed for a particular business purpose.


# Purpose of the AS-11 X8 Specification

## Aims

This Specification aims to define a file format for the delivery of finished HD TV Programmes (MPEG-2) to [North American Broadcasters Association](http://www.nabanet.com/) (NABA) broadcasters. It aims to define:

* a vendor-neutral and broadcaster-neutral package, using open technologies for delivery of finished programming from program producers and program distributors to broadcast stations
* a package that is sufficiently simple so as to limit the scope for interoperability problems
* a self-contained & play-out ready package

## Some notes on practical use

* The content may be delivered at the broadcast bit-rate, picture format and aspect ratio, or it may be transcoded at the broadcast station to the bit-rates and formats required for particular broadcast channels. Similar transcoding may be applied to audio and captions; additionally, specific audio and caption tracks may be selected for different broadcast channels.
* The content may be pre-packaged for broadcast without further changes or it may be segmented for ease of insertion or replacement of interstitials.
* There may be more than one package per programme.
* The package may contain some pre and post roll content not for transmission.


# Understanding the Specification Blocks Tree

This Specification is formed of "Blocks" that naturally form a "tree". A rendering / view of this tree is shown below and is explained here.

## Entities Summary
The Specification-writing framework used to produce this Specification has several different types of component / entity. In summary:

* Each Specification is composed of a single Top-Level **Block (B)**
* Blocks are defined by containing **Artefacts (A)** or linking directly to other Blocks
* Artefacts often refer to **Terms (T)** and **References (R)** as well as Blocks
* Blocks are sometimes described by **Notes (N)**

Each entity is identified by a unique URL.

Some of the letters in brackets above are used in the tree view to identify the type of each entity.

## Conformance

An implementation complies with a Block if it complies with all of the Blocks / Artefacts from which it is constructed. "Informative" statements do not have to be complied with (details of "informative" statements are given below).

* Compliance with some Blocks is not mandatory. Such Blocks are marked with an alternative "conformance" state (such as "optional" or "recommended").
* The name / title of an entity is considered "informative", as is its "description" (if present).
* "Note" entities are considered "informative".
* Prose Artefacts are written as statements of fact. An implementation complies with one of these Artefacts if the stated fact is True for the implementation.
* Some Artefacts are "data files" such as SMPTE Metadata Registers XML files or XML Schema files. Some of these may be partially rendered below. An implementation must always fully comply with these data files.

_Note that an Artefact does not always make sense on its own: all of the Artefacts contained within a Block need to be read (in order) to understand the Block fully and correctly._

## Parameter Blocks

There are two special types of Block which allow the value of one Block to be set by another Block:

* **Parameter Key Block (K)** -- this is a Block whose value must be set elsewhere in the Specification (it effectively defines a "variable" or an "argument")
* **Parameter Value Block (V)** -- this is a Block which sets the value of a specific Parameter Key Block (K)

                                * The `RFC5646SpokenLanguage` property of the {MCALabelSubDescriptor} is defined in SMPTE ST 377-4:2012 as having the type "ISO-8String". This type is undefined.
                                
                                * However, the entry for `RFC5646SpokenLanguage` in the SMPTE Elements Register correctly lists the type as "ISO7", which refers to "ISO/IEC 646:1991, Information technology -- ISO 7-bit coded character set for information interchange.". That is the same character repertoire referenced by IETF RFC 5646.

                        <SoundfieldGroupLabelSubDescriptor>s and <GroupOfSoundfieldGroupsLabelSubDescriptor>s could all be on one <Sound Track> or distributed. Hence, even the <GroupOfSoundfieldGroupsLabelSubDescriptor>s might not be on the same <Sound Track>.
                        
                        If several <Soundfield Group>s reference a single <Group of Soundfield Groups> then there will be more than one <GroupOfSoundfieldGroupsLabelSubDescriptor> for that <Group of Soundfield Groups>. That is, it is repeated for each <Soundfield Group> that references it.
                        
                        
                        # Type of RFC5646SpokenLanguage property
                        
                        The value of this property is encoded as a US-ASCII string with one byte per character.
                        
                        Details:
                        
                        * The `RFC5646SpokenLanguage` property of the {MCALabelSubDescriptor} is defined in SMPTE ST 377-4:2012 as having the type "ISO-8String". This type is undefined.
                        
                        * However, the entry for `RFC5646SpokenLanguage` in the SMPTE Elements Register correctly lists the type as "ISO7", which refers to "ISO/IEC 646:1991, Information technology -- ISO 7-bit coded character set for information interchange.". That is the same character repertoire referenced by IETF RFC 5646.

                    [A] The MCA Tag Symbols for labels that are used here but defined elsewhere have had prefixes applied to the values specified in their defining documents.
                        
                        These prefixes (`ch` for Audio Channel; `sg` for Soundfield Group; `gg` for Group of Soundfield Group) are also applied by the Digital Cinema and IMF applications of the Multichannel Audio Labeling framework (SMPTE ST 377-4), so this Specification uses the same MCA Tag Symbols as used in those applications.

                        Other valid combinations of "Soundfield Group" and "Group of Soundfield Groups" Labels are also possible.

            [A] # "MCA Label Dictionary ID" Labels Used
                
                Note that no constraint is placed on which "MCA Label Dictionary ID" Labels can be used in the file. The stated constraint simply means that implementations that comply with this Block must be able to support all of the specified Labels. In practice this means that for most real Sound Tracks the specified Labels ought to be used but alternative Labels can be used if the need arises (for example to support the delivery of additional specialist Sound Tracks for which Labels have been privately agreed between the supplier and the broadcaster).

                    <URL: http://vm-1274-user.virt.ch.bbc.co.uk/as/note/E9/>
                    [A] ## XML Document size limits
                        The constraints mean that Byte 6 of the two set keys will be 53h. The amount of text data must be equal to or less than 65535 bytes.
                        
                        ## Amendment
                        A crucial amendment to ST 2057 exists and must be read carefully -- it changes the ULs of various keys used in the Standard.

                        SMPTE ST 2020-1 specifies that the SDID value within the VANC Data Packet be used to identify the Sound Tracks that make up the Audio Program. For example, VANC Data Packets that contain Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream for a 5.1 channel Audio Program starting at channel pair 5/6 will require the SDID value in the VANC Data Packet to be set to 04h.
                        
                        However, this approach only works inside an MXF file if every Audio Channel in the file is identifiable using a pan-file channel number. This is the case if, for example, the Sound Tracks in the MXF file are numbered mono Sound Tracks.
                        
                        However, if the Sound Tracks in the MXF file are Multichannel Sound Tracks then this approach does not work. Some consequences of this:
                        
                        * The value to be used for SDID is undefined.
                        * If more than one 5.1 SoundfieldGroup (and at least one Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream) is included in the file then an external mechanism is needed to relate SoundfieldGroups and Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstreams.
                        * The SDID values might need to be rewritten upon output so that they correctly identify the Audio Channels that are being used to carry the relevant SoundfieldGroup / Audio Program. For example, this might be the case when playing out an MXF file to SDI -- particularly if only certain audio is played out or the audio layout is changed.
                        
                        # DID value
                        
                        VANC Data Packets that are carrying Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream will have a DID value of 45h.
                        
                        # Packets are not constant throughout
                        
                        SMPTE 2020-B requires that there is "one packet in each field of interlaced video formats". However, the two packets in each interlaced video frame are not identical.
                        
                        The values of SMPTE RDD 6 metadata properties might change from one frame to the next, but normally they will not. However, the VANC Data Packets in the file will not be identical even if the metadata is static: the "frame_count" will certainly increment and the "description_text" (if not null) will change.
                        
                        # Other data being carried in the ANC Frame Element
                        
                        The ANC Frame Element can also contain HANC Data Packets and other VANC Data Packets in addition to those carrying Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstreams. Irrespective of what data is carried in the ANC Frame Element, there is only ever one Track (in each of the Material Package and Top-Level File Package), one Data Element, and one associated Essence Descriptor in the MXF file.
